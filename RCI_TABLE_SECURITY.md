# RCI_ Table Security Filter

## Overview
The Road Condition Indexer database module now includes security filtering to restrict access to only tables that start with the "RCI_" prefix. This prevents unauthorized access to system tables or other application tables that may exist in the same database.

## Security Implementation

### Affected Methods
The following database methods now enforce RCI_ table filtering:

1. **`get_table_summary()`** - Only returns tables starting with "RCI_"
2. **`get_last_table_rows(table_name)`** - Rejects non-RCI_ table names
3. **`test_table_operations(table_name)`** - Rejects non-RCI_ table names
4. **`backup_table(table_name)`** - Rejects non-RCI_ table names
5. **`rename_table(old_name, new_name)`** - Rejects if either name doesn't start with "RCI_"
6. **`table_exists(table_name)`** - Returns False for non-RCI_ tables

### SQL Query Filtering
For methods that list tables, the SQL queries have been updated:

**SQL Server:**
```sql
-- Before
SELECT name FROM sys.tables
-- After  
SELECT name FROM sys.tables WHERE name LIKE 'RCI_%'
```

**SQLite:**
```sql
-- Before
SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'
-- After
SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' AND name LIKE 'RCI_%'
```

### Application-Level Validation
For methods that operate on specific tables, validation is added:

```python
def some_table_operation(self, table_name: str):
    # Only allow tables that start with RCI_
    if not table_name.startswith("RCI_"):
        raise ValueError("Access denied: Only RCI_ tables are allowed")
    # ... rest of method
```

## Current RCI_ Tables
The system currently uses these RCI_ tables:

- **`RCI_bike_data`** - Main data storage for bike sensor readings
- **`RCI_debug_log`** - Enhanced logging with filtering capabilities  
- **`RCI_device_nicknames`** - Device identification and naming

## Security Benefits

1. **Isolation** - Prevents accidental access to system or other application tables
2. **Data Protection** - Ensures database operations only affect intended tables
3. **Audit Trail** - All table operations are logged and restricted to known tables
4. **Principle of Least Privilege** - Only grants access to tables needed for functionality

## Error Handling
When non-RCI_ tables are accessed, the system responds with:
- **ValueError**: "Access denied: Only RCI_ tables are allowed"
- **table_exists()**: Returns `False` (silent denial)
- **get_table_summary()**: Excludes from results (filtered out)

## Testing
The implementation includes comprehensive testing in `test_rci_filter.py` which verifies:
- ✅ RCI_ tables remain fully accessible
- ✅ Non-RCI_ tables are blocked from all operations
- ✅ Table listings only include RCI_ tables
- ✅ Error messages are appropriate

## Migration Notes
- No breaking changes for existing functionality
- All RCI_ tables continue to work normally
- Enhanced security is transparent to normal operations
- Backup and maintenance operations are restricted to RCI_ tables only

This security enhancement ensures that the Road Condition Indexer database operations are properly scoped and cannot inadvertently affect other database objects.
